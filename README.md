## Google Play Music Random Album Playlist

If you're into listening to albums as a whole rather than picking and choosing some of your favorite songs, there's no good way to listen to whole albums in a randomized order.  You can go through and add albums to a playlist in whatever order you choose, but what if you want it randomized and, well, automated?

This script allows you to do just that.  Just fill in the list with either the names of the album, enter the appropriate login information, and run the script.

It's recommended that you create an [app password](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords) for use with this script.
